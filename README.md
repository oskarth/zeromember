# Zeromember

Re-init here.

What do we want to do? We want to do SNARKs. And have a button that proves and verifies. We already have the basic circuits defined, so now just need to hook it up to the snarkjs functions.

## TODO

- add input
- calculate witness
- generate proof
- validate proof
- serve the various assets from fs for browser usage
- use semaphore
- hook up to github
