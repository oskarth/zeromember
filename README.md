# Zeromember

Re-init here.

What do we want to do? We want to do SNARKs. And have a button that proves and verifies. We already have the basic circuits defined, so now just need to hook it up to the snarkjs functions.

## TODO

- Prove hook up to actual prover from browser
- use semaphore
- hook up to github
